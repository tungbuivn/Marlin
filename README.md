Th√≠ project intend to create custom pcb for the voron 2.4 which capacitive of:
- milling-able by mini cnc machine
- use board STM32F407VET6
- ability handle 740W bed power
- Support two power source at once
- Support atleast 7 motor
- Support external arduino sdcard (if there is free pin, need to separate from board to put it any where)
- z-axis divide into front and back
- use tmc 2009 driver with USART
